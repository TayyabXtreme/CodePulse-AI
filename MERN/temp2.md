❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a+b;}
```
🔍 Issues:
*   ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function's scope, which will likely lead to errors or unexpected behavior as the function will try to access variables from the outer scope (likely global scope).
*   ❌ The function doesn't accept any parameters, limiting its reusability and flexibility.
✅ Recommended Fix:
```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
💡 Improvements:
*   ✔ Accepts `a` and `b` as parameters, making the function self-contained and reusable.
*   ✔ Clear and concise, directly returning the sum of the two input parameters.
Final Note:
By explicitly defining `a` and `b` as parameters, the `sum` function becomes more predictable, testable, and robust. This change ensures that the function always operates on the provided inputs, avoiding potential issues with variable scope and unintended side effects.
